# Katou - Just another torrent-like P2P client.

Katou is just like any other P2P client with one clear goal: be as plain as possible.
While some P2P clients (regardless of protocol) are bloated, Katou aims to be lightweight.
However, through an API, developers can write plugins for Katou to implement features of their own!
